 My application example made with GETX

# Getx framework for
1. State Management
2. Dependency Injection
3. Route Management

# 3 basic principles of GetX
1. Performance (better than any previous stms, less memory usage)
2. Productivity (easy and simple syntax, saves development time)
3. Organization (decoupling of components)


# Pillars of GetX
 1. State Management (GetBuilder(Simple), GetX(reactive))
2. Route Management (Anything like snacbars,bottomsheet,dialog.routes all can be done without need of context
3. Dependency Management
